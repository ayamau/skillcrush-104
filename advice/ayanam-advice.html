			<h4>It takes a long time to learn something new</h4>
			<p>When you start doing something new, and by you I mean I, it takes a long time for it to sink in. Your brain has to learn all the rules and practice the processes. It's a challenge because everything seems like it takes forever. </p>

			<p>But there comes a time when the rules and the processes will become automatic and you can use all that free brain space to think and work things out logically instead of trying to remember the basics. It's like geometry proofs. </p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
